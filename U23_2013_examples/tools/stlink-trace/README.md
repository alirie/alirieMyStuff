This utility uses the integrated Trace Macrocell of the ARM core to perform character output.
The tool has been developed by Chris Storah and has been taken out of his github repository:
	https://github.com/obe1line/stlink-trace

It has been patched to remove some debugging output and a fflush(stdio) call has been added.
